NBA - Daily Scores Project
=====

The NBA daily scores project is designed to 
show NBA team scores for that day. 

Quick Start
-----------

1. get ``pip``
2. Use ``pip`` to install ``git``: ``pip install git``
3. ``git clone https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py``
  - From here, the ``nba_py`` repository should be in a local folder. This contains an NBA API which allows
    us to access NBA stats and scores.
4. From inside the ``nba_py`` folder inside a linux terminal:
   ``pip install .``: This will install the necessary nba_py files that can now be used for python using
   ``import nba_py``
5. Still inside nba_py: ``pip install Flask``
6. From ``nba_py_project`` directory: ``python __init__.py``
